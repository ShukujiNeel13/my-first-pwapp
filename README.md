#### Notes:
- I love to hear other perspectives and get feedback :)

  If you also tried this Google Codelab, or followed this workshop, please let me know your thoughts and suggestions. If you notice anything obsolete or wrong, I'll be really grateful if you would point it out to me, just send me a short quick email :D

- I like to try new things :)

  If you have any idea for a PWA and would like to collaborate / require guidance and assistance please send an email to me (My github profile has the details)

- You can create your first PWA by carefully following instructions in this README (or following the Codelab linked above) - Simple ! :)

  The pre requisites mentioned are recommended but not necessary for this demo app.

- This is not merely a copy paste of the Codelab :)

  I have executed each step and studied them carefully, adding in my twists, suggestions and recommendations where helpful

- Excuse me for imperfections.

  I've created this for learning and teaching others. It is not meant to be a professional / production app. The purpose is to learn and try the essentials of PWA.

- Tip to those who embark on new learning / coding journeys
  
  Never give up, never, ever, ever! (No matter how many obstacles you face, keep going!)
  Tough times never last, but tough people do >:)

- All credits to Google and all people involved in producing and serving this Codelab :)
